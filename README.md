This is just a run-through of the design patterns in Head First Design Patterns.

I am skipping iterations which utilise Java libraries, the book is crazy old so that mightn't be advisable anyway.
The main goal of this is to just run through the patterns in IntelliJ with Java before building versions of them in Kotlin.
I'm aiming to do as close to like-for-like comparisons as possible, hence why I'm avoiding Java libraries.

### To Run

The main class of each pattern is named after the pattern, w/e of the Abstract Factory Pattern, all code is contained within the one directory

### To be done:

- Facade: just seemed like a lot of typing and I have better things to do atm
- Composite: the example uses Java based iterators a lot so I'd rather do up something from scratch
- Proxy: honestly just had to return the book to the library and can't find my notes, don't want to work entirely from a pdf
- MVC: Might leave this for Kotlin as a bonus challenge
