A pattern to access elements sequentially without depending on loops (i.e. requiring a whole bunch of info about the class).

A more complex iteration might include:
 - bidirectional operations,
 - a remove option,
 - having the waitress decoupled from the iterator so as to handle both fixed and dynamic arrays.
